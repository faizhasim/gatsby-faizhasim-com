I am a single dad living with my boys in Kuala Lumpur.

I created this blog for quite a while ago to capture and share my thoughts on mainly programming and software. I would 
consider myself to be lucky to be able to work on something on my interest since I was a kid. It's pretty much working
with computers: coding, system architecture, building great products and more importantly, <strong>People</strong>.
There is less impact on working with computers alone, but if you're not dealing with people. It feels great to work on
something that has positive impact for people.

I enjoy planning (most of it adhoc planning) for weekend getaways with my boys. And to my boys, if you're reading this,
I'd treasure all the memories spend with you guys since you're still babies. I hope that when you grow older we can 
watch all the videos and photos that we took together on our adventures!

Life isn't easy for the past few years, and I have been focusing on different parts of life. I honestly feel like sharing
my life learning, experiences with dealing with people and legal stuff. Maybe some other day I will... I really feel that
people should know a bit about legal and your rights, so to ensure that people do not take advantage of your lack of
knowledge. I aim to write some thoughts on this, maybe a bit later. When things settle down a bit...
