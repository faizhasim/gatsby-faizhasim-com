## 👋 Hey, I'm Faiz

I'm an engineer (and a dad of two awesome boys) based in Kuala Lumpur.  
Over the years, I’ve moved between being an individual contributor, lead/staff engineer, and engineering manager — depending on what the team and situation needed.

I enjoy building and improving tools, systems, and processes that make engineers more effective and make day-to-day development a little more enjoyable. My work often revolves around **developer enablement**, **reliable software delivery**, and finding **practical ways to simplify complex systems**.

I’ve worked across frontend, backend, and cloud systems — and still like to write code when I can, especially in **TypeScript**, **Golang**, or **Scala**.  
I love the craft of building good software and helping people around me grow — even if I can’t resist tinkering with things that don’t really need tinkering.

## ⚙️ Tech & tools I enjoy

- **Languages:** TypeScript, Golang, Scala, Java
- **Ecosystem:** Node.js, React, AWS
- **Focus areas:** Developer enablement, tooling, system design, build & delivery automation
- **Tools I like:** Buildkite, Datadog, GitHub Actions, and a clean terminal setup

## 🧠 Stuff I think about

- How to make engineering teams happier and faster through better tools
- Keeping teams calm and productive without unnecessary process overhead
- Balancing code quality with “it needs to ship” pragmatism
- Why the best code is sometimes the one you never had to write
- Whether YAML is a lifestyle or a cry for help

## 🌱 Outside of work

I’m a single dad living with my boys in Kuala Lumpur.  
When I’m not working, I’m probably brewing coffee (V60, espresso, or cold brew), reorganising my ~messy~ homey house, or planning (usually last-minute) weekend getaways with my kids.

To my boys — if you’re reading this someday — I treasure all the memories we’ve made since you were tiny, and I hope we’ll laugh at all our videos and photos together when you’re older ❤️
