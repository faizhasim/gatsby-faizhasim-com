It has been a very long time since I update this blog. There is a lot of things happening in my life since then. Lots of hatred, lots of betrayal, lots of negativity and bad people. But, in this dark days of my life, I found courage to move forward as I see the glimpse of sunshine over the horizon.

I found love. I found the trustful, good people in the least way expected – a reminder for not judging a book by it's cover. I just need to keep pushing forward, for me and my love ones.

Ever since becoming a single parent, I talk more to other single parents - talk about life, kids, experiences. And, what's happening in this world is really scary. Made me realised that my bad experience is not the worst compared to others. It sucks to have these bad experiences, especially when the bad guys kept oppressing us. But, I think, we just got to move forward and made adjustments as needed along the way.

I design and wrote software as part of my work, and I think the design intention of proper software development lifecycle can be applied to life. Set a vision for the life and establish some missions along the way. Execute whatever's needed in shorter goals. If a certain goal is failed to be achieved for whatever reasons, adjustments can be made with lesser impact to the main missions. 

By the way, I started to rediscover the beauty in capturing moments in life, in the form of photography and discover more in videography. My sons tends to be my primary subjects. I love seeing and watching memories from videos and photos in my collection, especially when I'm sitting here alone. Made me laugh, entertained and realised how should we cherish life as we move forward for better life in this world and tomorrow's.
