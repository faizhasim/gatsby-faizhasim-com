![Minecraft Hour of Code on Raspberry PI](./minecraft-hour-of-code-on-pi.jpg)

In the past, I mentioned a major blocker to setup a minimal Raspberry PI-based PC for my son: Compatibility of
Google Child account with the Raspbian OS (default linux distro for Raspberry PI). I mentioned an open source project
that deliver Chromium OS on Raspberry PI. This post is to share what I did to rectify the problems before. 

## Child Account via Family Link - Do not use it

I learn that, unless you are heavily invested in Google software and devices, do no setup a child account. You simply
just can't use it.

I am quite certain ChromeOS on actual Chromebook won't be an issue. Still, I was trying out my luck with Chromium OS
to log in via a child account. Nope, it does not work. Period. However, you are still able to log in as a guess user
and manually log in via Google services on the Chromium browser. I just feel thto at the experience is too cumbersome,
especially if I want to help my son focus on the actual work, rather than wasting time to login to multiple services
every single time.  

## I end up using Chromium OS

The experience in using Chromium OS, especially as a introductory OS to kids, is very welcoming. I am keeping the 
Raspberry PI as a "dumb terminal" and ensure the actual work are saved to the cloud. Thus, I will just leave it here for
now.

Just letting you know that as of today, the latest Chromium OS running on r77, which is quite dated.  

## So far...

Well, so far it works. My son was playing and learning block coding on [https://code.org/minecraft](https://code.org/minecraft).
The early part are just revision for him.

My other son, a 5 year old, use this briefly to complete a couple of questions from his Google Classroom assignments
from school. It was a counting exercise and he looks annoyed with different interactivity experience compared to iPad.
I think, he would prefer iPad at his age - simpler to interact, simpler to count and still better experience in general.
