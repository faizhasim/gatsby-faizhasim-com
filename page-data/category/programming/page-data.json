People that come from Node, might feel easier to get started without investing too much learning curve. JVM people might benefits Golang for faster startup time.  In the past, I made a careful decision to implement HTTP serverless using Node, due to the cold start concerns with JVM. With AWS Lambda supports for Golang, this is just superb. If I’m were to break down a large Node serverless function, I wouldn’t mind using Golang.\"\n","category":"Programming","title":"Golang: A Journey So Far","date":"2019-01-01T17:28:42","slug":"/posts/golang-a-journey-so-far"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2018-10-27---Functional-Programming-Concept-Example.md//posts/functional-programming-concept-and-example","categorySlug":"/category/programming"},"frontmatter":{"description":"Sharing my slide during my introductory sharing session in the office on the concepts and examples for practical functional programming.","category":"Programming","title":"Functional Programming: Concept & Example","date":"2018-10-27T17:28:42","slug":"/posts/functional-programming-concept-and-example"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2018-07-28---Event-Source-Journal-using-Akka-Persistence.md//posts/eventSource-journal-using-akka-persistence","categorySlug":"/category/programming"},"frontmatter":{"description":"I had the opportunity to spike a demo in our office and share my understanding on `EventSourcing` implementation using Akka Persistence.","category":"Programming","title":"EventSource Journal using Akka Persistence","date":"2018-07-28T17:28:42","slug":"/posts/eventSource-journal-using-akka-persistence"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2016-03-21---Geekcampmy-Talk-on-Moving-Learndotcom-from-Pet-Computing-to-Cattle-Computing.md//posts/seekcamp-my-talk-on-moving-learndot-from-pet-computing-to-cattle-computing","categorySlug":"/category/programming"},"frontmatter":{"description":"I had a change to share some works that we recently did for Learndot.com platform during the Geekcamp.my event.
