For example, mocking filesystem operations, is pretty much this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://talks.golang.org/2012/10things.slide#8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://talks.golang.org/2012/10things.slide#8</a></p>\n<p>It make sense. You don’t mock what you don’t own. But, the additional structs and interfaces just to support the mocks in test, is a bit annoying. I come from JVM and Node, so that might explain why. Javascript is pretty much dynamic. Mocking libraries on JVM usually rely on some sort of bytecode manipulations, so things are a bit easier.</p>\n<p>Again, still, I heard people said you might be able to do some crazy linking when compiling Go, but that’s just crazy.</p>\n<p>While it’s way harder to mock, it’s not a bad thing at all. It makes things that should rarely happen, hard.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dependency-injection\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#dependency-injection\" aria-label=\"dependency injection permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Dependency Injection</h2>\n<p>I wasn’t quite sure on how to implement DI with Go. The value of DI is tremendous when writing testable code.</p>\n<p>I was able to quickly write a bunch of functions and make simple code works. But, to make it more testable (especially if you’re doing some level of TDD), you might want to do with DI pattern.</p>\n<p>Blogpost from Go-Jet engineering really helps me: <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/the-many-flavours-of-dependency-injection-in-go-25aa070d79a0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://blog.gojekengineering.com/the-many-flavours-of-dependency-injection-in-go-25aa070d79a0</a>.</p>\n<p>But, more importantly, compile-time DI from golang.org is really exciting indeed! Check it out at <a href=\"https://blog.golang.org/wire\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://blog.golang.org/wire</a>. I haven’t really read the entire thing, but this reminds me a lot on MacWire (compile-time DI for Scala that leverages the <code class=\"language-text\">macro</code> feature).</p>\n<h2 id=\"current-impression\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#current-impression\" aria-label=\"current impression permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Current Impression</h2>\n<p>I think Golang has a huge potential.
