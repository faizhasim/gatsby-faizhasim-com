I do not need elasticity, although server elasticity is a very nice addition to any application including blogging platform.</p>\n<p>I have reviewed some cloud-based hosting and VPS. I have considered Linode, they are basically using VPS pricing model, but elastic enough to behave like a cloud-based service. As a matter of fact, Linode <strong>is</strong> running on cloud infrastructure. They have very good reviews on customer relation and supports. I did consider that, till I found Digital Ocean. The pricing model is very simple. For USD 5/month you can get 20 GB of SSD storage and 512 MB of RAM. Perfect to start up a blog. Furthermore, I manage to grab a promotion code which give me USD 10 credit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"going-back-to-why-do-this-\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#going-back-to-why-do-this-\" aria-label=\"going back to why do this  permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Going back to why do this …</h2>\n<p>My last post was in June 2013 and I am thinking of writing again. Similarly, my goal is to express my opinion mostly, but not limited to software development. Additionally, this time, I might chuck in some tutorials on programming if I have some time. I think I have learn a lot from all those free tutorials from the Internet. It is the right time to contribute back to the community.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you need me to write or explain anything (especially software development related (Java/JS/Objective C etc), let me know.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/898384/10412551/cca3989e-6fbb-11e5-861d-12e57958f02d.png\" alt=\"img\"></p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2013-11-09---Migrated-to-Digital-Ocean.md//posts/migrated-to-digital-ocean","tagSlugs":["/tag/blog/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2013-11-09T17:28:42","tags":["blog"],"title":"Migrated to Digital Ocean","description":"I am quite excited to today to announce that my blog has been migrated from faizhasim.bitnamiapp.com to www.faizhasim.com","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2013-11-09---Migrated-to-Digital-Ocean.md//posts/migrated-to-digital-ocean"}},"staticQueryHashes":["4208939363"],"slicesMap":{}}
