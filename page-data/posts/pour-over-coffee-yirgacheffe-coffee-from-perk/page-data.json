At one point of time, I stop brewing on\nthe espresso machine and use Aeropress almost exclusively. While I still very rarely use the Aeropress, my current\nbrewing technique is not predominantly pour over using V60.</p>\n<p>I am not saying that I am a true coffee aficionado, but the taste that I’m looking for is bright and clean taste\nwith a bit of mellow and sweetness. At the same time, I want to be pragmatic in terms of the approach, the money/cost\nfactor, the time and effort and more importantly the joy of a cup of good coffee.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">youtube:https://www.youtube.com/embed/fo8tEu5uIo4</code></p>\n<p>With Perks coffee, I have tried other blends or origins, but I end up getting this bean for pour over coffee. There are\nother reputable brewers in the region. Coffee like <a href=\"https://pppcoffee.com.my/products/suke-quto-washed-single-origin-espresso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Suke Quto</a>\nfrom <a href=\"https://pppcoffee.com.my/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">PPP Coffee</a> is not bad. I definitely like the seasonal coffee selection from the\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/threelittlebirdscoffee/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Three Little Birds</a> too, even though they may be a little bit more\nexpensive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"recipe\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#recipe\" aria-label=\"recipe permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Recipe?</h2>\n<p>No recipe. Ultimately, taste and overall experience depends on your tastebuds.</p>\n<p>I always brew for 300ml end result because that is the maximum volume of my cup. I use about 18g of coffee bean.\nMedium grind (took couple of tries with my grinder to get the right taste). Water is about 90-ish to 95 degree Celsius.</p>\n<p>I am not qualified enough to give you recipe but I can share some of my personal hacks/tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the coffee is bitter, chances that your grind is too fine.\nLikewise, if it’s under-extracted, they are probably too coarse.</li>\n<li>If you hate to wait for boiled water to cool down (morning rush to work), put couple of ice cubes while brewing.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://perkcoffee.co/my/product/ethiopia-yirgacheffe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Ethiopia Yirgacheffe coffee beans</a> taste wonderful with\ncold brew too. My hack for cold brew is to put about 30g of grinded coffee in the V60 paper filter and immerse it with\ncold water in a mug. Wait till the next morning, and you got a nice cold brewed coffee.\nI did this quite regularly when fasting during Ramadan.</li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-05-25---pour-over-coffee-yirgacheffe-coffee-from-perk.md//posts/pour-over-coffee-yirgacheffe-coffee-from-perk","tagSlugs":["/tag/coffee/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-05-25T10:58:01","tags":["coffee"],"title":"Pour Over Coffee - Yirgacheffe Coffee from Perk","description":"Today's post is about my current interest in coffee brewing using V60 pour over.
