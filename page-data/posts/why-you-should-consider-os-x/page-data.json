Some of the reasons that you might consider to switch to OSX (especially if you’ve been using Windows):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You want to use POSIX as part of you development workflow but you just hate using Cygwin on windows.</li>\n<li>As a normal user, you want your application deployment to be properly encapsulated. You do not want to uninstall an application, but you can still find “C:/Program Files/Application Name” after a successful uninstallation.</li>\n<li>But, as an advance user, you hate Windows package manager because you love things like apt-get or yum for better package manager.</li>\n<li>You just hate antivirus software.</li>\n<li>App switching is a pain.</li>\n<li>OS upgrade price.\n<ul>\n<li>OSX Mountain Lion is 20 bucks, OSX Mavericks is free.</li>\n<li>Be prepared to spend hundreds for Windows.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You still want to use Microsoft Office.\n<ul>\n<li>Still De Facto standard for most organization, unfortunately</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You love Linux (I know I do), but at the same time, you have a love-hate relationship with Linux because some applications looks ugly under KDE or Gnome. For example, Eclipse.</li>\n<li>As a software developer, you want most of the basic tools included with your OS with minimal configuration. For eg, multiplatform scripting languge Python/Ruby, built-in ssh/ftp, simple apache web server, dtrace, SVN/Git.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyway, I’m still waiting for Apple to add a functionality to Finder (like Windows Explorer), where I can browse directly by typing the path. <code class=\"language-text\">⌘</code>  <code class=\"language-text\">⇧</code>  <code class=\"language-text\">G</code> will just open a basic text field to type the path. I wanted something more like typical distribution of Linux, where you can just type at the toolbar and it has things like autosuggest etc.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2013-01-13---Why-you-should-consider-OS-X.md//posts/why-you-should-consider-os-x","tagSlugs":["/tag/mac-os-x/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2013-01-13T17:28:42","tags":["mac os x"],"title":"Why you should consider OS X?","description":"Back in early 2008, I made a very bold decision to move from Windows to OSX and I must say, I am very happy that I made this transition.
