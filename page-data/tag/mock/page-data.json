People that come from Node, might feel easier to get started without investing too much learning curve. JVM people might benefits Golang for faster startup time.  In the past, I made a careful decision to implement HTTP serverless using Node, due to the cold start concerns with JVM. With AWS Lambda supports for Golang, this is just superb. If I’m were to break down a large Node serverless function, I wouldn’t mind using Golang.\"\n","slug":"/posts/golang-a-journey-so-far"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2013-11-20---Powermock-with-JUnit-4-to-Test-SpringHibernate-Architecture.md//posts/powermock-with-junit-4-to-test-spring-hibernate-architecture","categorySlug":"/category/programming"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Powermock with JUnit 4 to Test Spring+Hibernate Architecture","date":"2013-11-20T17:28:42","category":"Programming","description":"I've been working on developing this webapp project.
