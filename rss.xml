&lt;p&gt;I am a bit annoyed with the amount of code that I need to write to mock sideeffects, especially if you have no control over it. For example, mocking filesystem operations, is pretty much this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://talks.golang.org/2012/10things.slide#8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://talks.golang.org/2012/10things.slide#8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It make sense. You don’t mock what you don’t own. But, the additional structs and interfaces just to support the mocks in test, is a bit annoying. I come from JVM and Node, so that might explain why. Javascript is pretty much dynamic. Mocking libraries on JVM usually rely on some sort of bytecode manipulations, so things are a bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, still, I heard people said you might be able to do some crazy linking when compiling Go, but that’s just crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s way harder to mock, it’s not a bad thing at all. It makes things that should rarely happen, hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dependency-injection&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#dependency-injection&quot; aria-label=&quot;dependency injection permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Dependency Injection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t quite sure on how to implement DI with Go. The value of DI is tremendous when writing testable code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to quickly write a bunch of functions and make simple code works. But, to make it more testable (especially if you’re doing some level of TDD), you might want to do with DI pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogpost from Go-Jet engineering really helps me: &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.gojekengineering.com/the-many-flavours-of-dependency-injection-in-go-25aa070d79a0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://blog.gojekengineering.com/the-many-flavours-of-dependency-injection-in-go-25aa070d79a0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, more importantly, compile-time DI from golang.org is really exciting indeed! Check it out at &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.golang.org/wire&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://blog.golang.org/wire&lt;/a&gt;. I haven’t really read the entire thing, but this reminds me a lot on MacWire (compile-time DI for Scala that leverages the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;macro&lt;/code&gt; feature).&lt;/p&gt;

There is a lot of things happening in my life since then. Lots of hatred, lots of betrayal, lots of negativity and bad people. But, in this dark days of my life, I found courage to move forward as I see the glimpse of sunshine over the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found love. I found the trustful, good people in the least way expected – a reminder for not judging a book by it’s cover. I just need to keep pushing forward, for me and my love ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since becoming a single parent, I talk more to other single parents - talk about life, kids, experiences. And, what’s happening in this world is really scary. Made me realised that my bad experience is not the worst compared to others. It sucks to have these bad experiences, especially when the bad guys kept oppressing us. But, I think, we just got to move forward and made adjustments as needed along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I design and wrote software as part of my work, and I think the design intention of proper software development lifecycle can be applied to life. Set a vision for the life and establish some missions along the way. Execute whatever’s needed in shorter goals. If a certain goal is failed to be achieved for whatever reasons, adjustments can be made with lesser impact to the main missions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I started to rediscover the beauty in capturing moments in life, in the form of photography and discover more in videography. My sons tends to be my primary subjects. I love seeing and watching memories from videos and photos in my collection, especially when I’m sitting here alone. Made me laugh, entertained and realised how should we cherish life as we move forward for better life in this world and tomorrow’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A picture is worth a thousand words&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, imagine videography…&lt;/p&gt;

It’s about moving the Learndot platform from &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Pet computing&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Cattle computing&lt;/code&gt;, by leveraging AWS cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

        NOTE: I created the slides for my talk for offline presentation and I didn&apos;t really compress the assets.

&lt;p&gt;We started new year 2016 with biannual ServiceRocket Engineering hackaton event, which is really awesome week for us! We would spend a week to turn an idea into a working prototype in a week time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to participate along with my teammates, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.longyc.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Long&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://herrowna.xyz&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Helena&lt;/a&gt;.
We called ourselves, the Team Rocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/898384/12717569/aa52200a-c923-11e5-98fb-0700da961daa.png&quot; alt=&quot;team rocket&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We really had a tough time getting the right idea for the hackaton and ultimately, we came out with Tachyon – a service that complements &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.learndot.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Learndot&lt;/a&gt; LMS to make invitation to your academy as easy as capturing business card from your smartphone. It is not just a product, it is a production-quality service, which would allow buck scanning of business cards (or any documents) for Learndot academy invites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tesseract&lt;/a&gt; and I was absolutely certain that I could just find some Docker image from the Dockerhub. So, I can just spin up a container and write another service that consume the Tessaract API. But then, I stumble upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openocr.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;OpenOCR&lt;/a&gt;, which build more goodness on top of Tessaract. I really need to give the credit to those guys for open sourcing their work. We were using their example as docker-compose setup according the diagram below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/898384/12717784/2ec63c62-c925-11e5-9917-88c9c948f223.png&quot; alt=&quot;architecture&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, they have proper RabbitMQ in place, with Tessaract workers and expose everything as REST-ful API for my consumption. Additionally, we also use additional iamge preprocessing by them for stroke width transformation to enchance the image quality for OCR purposes. Without doing too much, more than 50% of the work has been completed for us by choosing the right solution and technology. I think that’s very important for a hackaton project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main service that we need is just another REST API on top of the existing OpenOCR API. It would accept valid multipart-encoded image, submit to the OpenOCR backend, then call Learndot API to send an invitation if emails are found and finally give a response back to the caller. We wrote it in NodeJS, although we can pretty much do with anything. We called this Luxon as illustrated below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/898384/12719667/84050ecc-c931-11e5-86e2-68928573d50a.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the works are writing client app that consume the main API and do fancy stuff to impress the audience. We planned for 3 different type of clients; Web Client optimised for mobile, Native Client for Android/iOS and simple CLI for batch processing. We delievered two out of three as we are having some technical issues with the native client. Regardless, we are pretty happy with the work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our slide during the demo can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/faizhasim/faizhasim.github.io/files/112357/2016-02-01.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Our aim is focussed on impressing people that come from different background, both techies and non-techies. Hence, the objectives of our presentation is to ensure that we are selling the idea well and capture the technical details in a simplest manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tachyon is also hosted on Digital Ocean cloud, to ensure that my machine won’t do anything funny during the presentation. I also configured &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.learndot.xyz&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;learndot.xyz&lt;/a&gt; for vanity factor 😀. We wanted to show the ability of our service works well for batch processing, so we begun collecting business cards from almost everyone in Level 5 the day before. We’ll use those for live demo on the smartphone and ScanSnap scanner for batch processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are the runner up, but I think we nail the presentation regardless. The live demo on my iPhone works great. I was able to invite a bunch of people to Learndot simply by dumping their business cards to the scanner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[JavaScript DOM Testing With Mocha + Grunt + Chai jQuery]]></title><description><![CDATA[I'd like to share my work on writing JavaScript DOM unit testing on a existing codebase in one of our Confluence plugins.]]></description><link>https://www.faizhasim.com/posts/javascript-dom-testing-with-mocha-grunt-chai-jquery</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.faizhasim.com/posts/javascript-dom-testing-with-mocha-grunt-chai-jquery</guid><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2014 09:28:42 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I’d like to share my work on writing JavaScript DOM unit testing on a existing codebase in one of our Confluence plugins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goals of this unit testing are as following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simulate JavaScript and DOM as close as possible to actual browser environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to easily integrate this to CI services&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to document these steps for our own reference and install and configure &lt;a href=&quot;https://npmjs.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;NPM&lt;/a&gt; on your machine. For OSX users that use &lt;a href=&quot;http://brew.sh&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;HomeBrew&lt;/a&gt;, just do &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sudo brew install npm&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, make sure to install &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bower&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;grunt-cli&lt;/code&gt; globally on your node:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install -g grunt-cli bower&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our project, this was a “traditional” javascript codebase, probably written before things like NPM or Bower become more mainstream today. So, a new nodejs setup can be configured by calling &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm init&lt;/code&gt;, which will guide you to create &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My final &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;confluence-scaffolding&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;version&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;5.0.9-SNAPSHOT&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;grunt-contrib-handlebars&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;~0.6.0&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;description&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Currently used only for BDD test using Mocha&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;scripts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;grunt test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;install&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;bower install&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;grunt-**&lt;/code&gt; dependencies are Grunt task runners. Notice the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;script&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; part? That means, if I type &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;, it will trigger &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bower install&lt;/code&gt; too. Make sure to run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; to install those dependencies locally (you might want to disable the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bower install&lt;/code&gt; part temporarily for the first time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bower can be initiated in similar manner. Just type &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bower init&lt;/code&gt; to get bower to help you to initialised &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bower.json&lt;/code&gt;. See below for mine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;chai-jquery&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;~1.1.2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;aui&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/aui-dist/get/master.zip&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;sinonjs&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;~1.7.3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to control where Bower install these dependencies, instead of putting them into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bower_components&lt;/code&gt; directory. So, I’ve also created &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.bowerrc&lt;/code&gt; and specify the location as following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;directory&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;lib&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should probably run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bower install&lt;/code&gt; after writing those. It will pull out all the assets to the corresponding directories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grunt can be configured within a file called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Gruntfile.js&lt;/code&gt;. Here’s an example of mine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;module.exports = function(grunt) &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    grunt.initConfig(&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        pkg&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grunt.file.readJSON(&apos;package.json&apos;)&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &apos;jsmin-sourcemap&apos;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            all&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                src&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                    &apos;forms&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/**/&lt;/span&gt;*.js&apos;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                dest&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &apos;tests/scaffold-combined.min.js&apos;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                destMap&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &apos;tests/scaffold-combined.min.js.map&apos;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                srcRoot&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &apos;../&apos;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        mocha&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

                    run&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my initial version, I wrote that using &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeescript.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Coffeescript&lt;/a&gt;. Honestly, I like it. It was more readable, but I think it’s better to keep it as JS for now. &lt;a href=&quot;http://gruntjs.com/getting-started&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://gruntjs.com/getting-started&lt;/a&gt; has excellent documentation on how to use Grunt, I would strongly suggest for you to read that. But, I just want to highlight some of the reasons or explanations on the task configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;jsmin-sourcemap&lt;/code&gt; – Used to compile all of existing production source code into a single JS file, to make test easier and replicate what Atlassian do with the YUI compressor. One nice thing about this task is, it produces source map! See this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; on what is source map and why it’s so damn cool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mocha&lt;/code&gt; – Our mocha configuration. Note: This &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;grunt-mocha&lt;/code&gt; &lt;strong&gt;is not&lt;/strong&gt; for running mocha on NPM environment. It basically run mocha test within PhantomJS. We purposedly set the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;run: false&lt;/code&gt; due to the fact that we will trigger this on our &lt;a href=&quot;http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt; loading in the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;handlebars&lt;/code&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;http://handlebarsjs.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Handlebars&lt;/a&gt; is a variant of MustacheJS, but with helpers and additional features. I use this to separate the mocked DOM, instead of bundling them into the JS code. I don’t want to keep pulling my hair later for unmanage codebase. Honestly, I can just interpret the mocked DOM as plaintext, but I might as well configure it as template because I thought that we might use that for future test anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;watch&lt;/code&gt; - A file watcher. It watched over on group of files. On any changes, it will trigger the selected Grunt task. I used this when writing the test. Just run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;grunt watch&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the directory structure here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; - The main page entry for the Mocha test. I think I can probably make a single html entry for the test, and multiple JavaScript sources loaded via AMD to run the test. It’s more managable imo. As long as the JavaScript source does not pollute global context and override each other, it’s fine. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; - Main entry for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;requirejs&lt;/code&gt; AMD loading. This is where I define the configuration the require js too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;repeatingComponentTest&lt;/code&gt; - This is an example for a test suite. I bundled all the assets (mainly Handlebar templates and Mocha test in JavaScript) within their own directory. So, if I want to test featureB in the future, I’ll just create a directory called featureB and let AMD call the test from &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to load everything using AMD loading, but I was unable to load Atlassian’s AUI, sinonjs and mocha. While AUI and sinonjs are not written as modules, I am not exactly understand why I can’t load mocha using AMD. Some people in the community reports the same thing. So, for those libraries, I load them manually via &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag within &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file, I’ve also introduced a DOM element for all my test: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;test&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See my requireJs configuration below. I think, you probably need to refer &lt;a href=&quot;http://requirejs.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;RequireJS Documentation&lt;/a&gt; itself if you’re not familiar with AMD or RequireJS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two interesting things I want to highlight here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tpl&lt;/code&gt; – is the template module for the Handlebars template. It is compiled by Grunt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;require([&amp;#39;repeatingComponentTest/list-field.js&amp;#39;], function(require) {&lt;/code&gt; – This block of code is where I can control on which test module I want to load for mocha test. The following &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mocha.run()&lt;/code&gt; is the reason why I disabled automatic &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mocha.run()&lt;/code&gt; from Grunt task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read more on the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Mocha Documentation&lt;/a&gt; itself. A few things that I want to highlight from this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;use strict&amp;quot;;&lt;/code&gt; whenever possible in your JavaScript code. Enabling strict mode should be a default thing to do, unless you’re writing some hacky stuff and know what you’re doing. From my experience, global variable pollution is one of the biggest problem I had so far on maintaining legacy code. Easily avoidable with strict mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used CommonJS style within RequireJS. For eg: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;var chai = require(&amp;#39;chai&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;writing-test--some-tips&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#writing-test--some-tips&quot; aria-label=&quot;writing test  some tips permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Writing Test • Some Tips&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test it on Google Chrome browser, before running &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;grunt test&lt;/code&gt; to test it on PhantomJS. Make debugging a hell lot easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re making actual AJAX call from &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;file:&lt;/code&gt; location, Chrome won’t like it. Start chrome with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-allow-file-access-from-files&lt;/code&gt; parameter if you need to override that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use inline &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;debugger&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;console.log(...)&lt;/code&gt; for debugging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need to make trivial changes on the JS file without keep switching application? Just write it in Google Chrome debugger itself. They have live code / html editing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ps: I’m on leave writing this blog post from my hotel. The actual code base is still on pull request for peer review. I will probably update this blog post again.&lt;/p&gt;

Basically, we break the logical parts of the code into entity layer, service layer and UI layer. The data structure is not that complex, so we thought that we use Hibernate ORM to do its magic. All the plumbing works between these layers were managed via Spring dependency injection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use Vaadin (built on top GWT) as our presentation layer where I’ve tried to enforce supervising view controller design pattern for better view and the associated view controller separation. I hope, this will make unit and integration testing easier in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I have taken the approach where I create the application without unit test, simply because we need to deliver the application for prelimanary review in shortest amount of time. So now, I’m starting to get a little bit serious on unit testing the components in the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my testing requirement, I am planning to use JUnit 4 that play nicely with Spring frameworks. But, there are things that are still coupled between service and presentation layer, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be more specific, the web presentation layer will automatically capture the logged in user details (including things like IP address and web browser details). We need a mocking framework to work with current JUnit assertion tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have reviewed some awesome Java mocking libraries such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://easymock.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;EasyMock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/mockito/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Mockito&lt;/a&gt;, but I found the best of mocking libraries called: &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/powermock/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;PowerMock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really nice for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;PowerMock&lt;/code&gt; is (taken directly from their website):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerMock uses a custom classloader and bytecode manipulation to enable &lt;strong&gt;mocking of static methods&lt;/strong&gt;, constructors, final classes and methods, private methods, removal of static initializers and more…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I can mock my static method to retrieve the logged in user information with just 2 simple line of code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; currentlyLoggedUser &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Some dummy user&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mockStatic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;SpringSecurityHelper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;SpringSecurityHelper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getCurrentUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;thenReturn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;currentlyLoggedUser&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, PowerMock does not play nicely with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class&lt;/code&gt; JUnit runner. Even though PowerMock tried to mitigate this problem by bootstraping JUnit rule  &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/powermock/wiki/PowerMockRule&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;PowerMockRule&lt;/a&gt;, Hibernate does not like this. I suspect because Hibernate relies on on &lt;a href=&quot;http://cglib.sourceforge.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;CGLib&lt;/a&gt; to create some proxies to the entity classes by manipulating bytecode during runtime, which exactly what PowerMock do. If you’re interested on sample code, somebody wrote a blog post on how to do that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jayway.com/2010/12/28/using-powermock-with-spring-integration-testing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.jayway.com/2010/12/28/using-powermock-with-spring-integration-testing/&lt;/a&gt;. I think, if you’re not using Hibernate, it’s a really nice, clean way of writing a unit test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, ultimately, what I did was to run the JUnit test with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;PowerMockRunner.class&lt;/code&gt;, but manually initiate the Spring context on &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@Before&lt;/code&gt; method. It works beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a simple example below to demonstrate what I did on actual code.&lt;/p&gt;

AWS could be a little bit on the expensive side when it comes to normal blog/publication hosting, but I got 1 year free hosting, so I might as well use it. The old blog run on plain ol’ Wordpress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I migrated from Wordpress to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ghost.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;, a blogging platform written ground-up on top of NodeJS stack. I like their mission statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a blogging platform&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Backed by dedicated designer who aim to make UI/UX simple, clean and “mobile-first”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghost is designed for the best blogging experience, which translates to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy system for me to maintain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No convoluted PHP code mess like Wordpress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Written in NodeJS with Handlebar templating, which means easier for me to override the themes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community driven. It’s actually crowd-funded project.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS is expensive for blogging. I do not need elasticity, although server elasticity is a very nice addition to any application including blogging platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have reviewed some cloud-based hosting and VPS. I have considered Linode, they are basically using VPS pricing model, but elastic enough to behave like a cloud-based service. As a matter of fact, Linode &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; running on cloud infrastructure. They have very good reviews on customer relation and supports. I did consider that, till I found Digital Ocean. The pricing model is very simple. For USD 5/month you can get 20 GB of SSD storage and 512 MB of RAM. Perfect to start up a blog. Furthermore, I manage to grab a promotion code which give me USD 10 credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My last post was in June 2013 and I am thinking of writing again. Similarly, my goal is to express my opinion mostly, but not limited to software development. Additionally, this time, I might chuck in some tutorials on programming if I have some time. I think I have learn a lot from all those free tutorials from the Internet. It is the right time to contribute back to the community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need me to write or explain anything (especially software development related (Java/JS/Objective C etc), let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s focus on website, how easy to build them? On a few occasions, I’ve been asked to develop websites for whatever reasons and most of the time on voluntary basis. I had to turn down most of them. It’s a very hard thing to decline people’s request especially from friends, but I had to decline the request. If I have some time, resources and not doing anything else, I will try to help them. But, most of the time, I don’t have the luxury to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my early uni days, I only managed to develope a website for our club. Towards the end of my studies, I had to refuse some of my friends’ request to help them build some more websites. I am sorry if you read this. At that time, spending lots of time making websites etc is probably not the best thing to do considering my grades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even now working as a software developer, I am not as free as the first year in Uni. I’ve got to work. I want to spend my remaining time with my family especially with this little wee guy, who’s fast asleep with his mum. There are time (like now), my workload is quite heavy. I just stopped doing office-related work to type this blog entry (and it’s 2am). So… it’s not as free… I had to say no to the people who ask my help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl;dr – Developing a website is quite similar to developing a house. More complex the requirements, more complex the development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My analogy to building a “simple” website is similar to asking someone to build a “simple” self-assembly house. You already have all the pieces for the constructions. Anyone with basic construction skills will just do. After all, they just need to assemble all pieces. But, even that, it will take some times to come out a complete house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same thing with building a simple website. Based on the given requirements, you already know that you probably need a few pages with some links that need to be “glued” together. Anyone with basic  software skills can do this with some helps with the readily available software tools. But, even so, doing this will definitely take some time to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly to a finished self-assembly house, I wouldn’t put even a “simple” website into the WWW untested. Some things may break and cause trouble to whoever visit the website. I’ve got to do some regression tests to the website first, check whether those “simple” links are working or not. If it’s not, what’s the point of making a website in the first place? During the regression testing phase, I will probably spend some more time to fix the problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I would say building a minimal, properly tested website, would optimistically take a week to complete if you this on casual basis, if not more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, people don’t actually know what they want although they have some rough idea. Let’s take an analogy to a house. It’s like having an idea to live in big and modern house, but you didn’t know exactly what. Do you want to make a small lowrise house? Do you want to make a terrace house? Do you want to make a bungalow house? Do you want to make high-rise flats or condos? Or do you want to make a mansion? So, you seek an architect before telling the house builder on your house design. Just because the idea is simple, that doesn’t mean that the actual work will be simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same thing with software. Many people have ideas to create a social media or website where people can post news so that others can see. But, very few can even nourish the idea to captivate attentions from others. Zuckerberg may be one of these few people. In this case, he’s the architect of his software. He’s also the developer and builder for his own software (initially). Some says that the original idea of making Facebook is not his, which is the exact point I want to stress here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, just to get my readers some rough idea on how much effort does it take to build a complex website… First of all, at this scale, a better technical term is web application. Simply because it wont be multiple pages that are links together to form a website. Web application sort of means, your normal desktop applications like MS Word or Reminder app, and put it to the web. Sometimes, web application can be more complex than your average desktop application because web application logics are computed/stored somewhere else in the server. But, you will have probably hundreds or thousands of concurrent users accessing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these complex logics are abstracted away from the users. Simply said, you won’t know about this if you didn’t do this line of job. So, it’s like typical house buyers. Sometimes, people may perceive it as a simple thing to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best example that I can give for a complex web app is what my team is doing atm: cloud-based Electronic Document and Record Management System (if you’re working for government, you will probably use this later). It’s not just me. It’s a team who build this. There’s also someone in our team who’re very experience in both record management and this technical field and architect almost everything in the application. The rest of us have experiences ranging from 1 year to 10 years on this technical field. And, we do need more talented people in the team. Well, if possible, I do want some people working under me. So… the main point is… it’s not so easy to create something simple or simplistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this also applies to other softwares, not just making websites. You may see and think that this tiny little app on your mobile phone looks easy to make. Not necessarily true.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why you should consider OS X?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Back in early 2008, I made a very bold decision to move from Windows to OSX and I must say, I am very happy that I made this transition.

Some of the reasons that you might consider to switch to OSX (especially if you’ve been using Windows):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to use POSIX as part of you development workflow but you just hate using Cygwin on windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a normal user, you want your application deployment to be properly encapsulated. You do not want to uninstall an application, but you can still find “C:/Program Files/Application Name” after a successful uninstallation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But, as an advance user, you hate Windows package manager because you love things like apt-get or yum for better package manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You just hate antivirus software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App switching is a pain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OS upgrade price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OSX Mountain Lion is 20 bucks, OSX Mavericks is free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be prepared to spend hundreds for Windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You still want to use Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still De Facto standard for most organization, unfortunately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You love Linux (I know I do), but at the same time, you have a love-hate relationship with Linux because some applications looks ugly under KDE or Gnome. For example, Eclipse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a software developer, you want most of the basic tools included with your OS with minimal configuration. For eg, multiplatform scripting languge Python/Ruby, built-in ssh/ftp, simple apache web server, dtrace, SVN/Git.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I’m still waiting for Apple to add a functionality to Finder (like Windows Explorer), where I can browse directly by typing the path. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;⌘&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;⇧&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;G&lt;/code&gt; will just open a basic text field to type the path. I wanted something more like typical distribution of Linux, where you can just type at the toolbar and it has things like autosuggest etc.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[For-loop, to ++i or i++ or not?]]></title><description><![CDATA[I just recalled an interesting theory mentioned by my C lecturer back in uni days, use ++i instead of i++ in a for-loop.]]></description><link>https://www.faizhasim.com/posts/for-loop</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.faizhasim.com/posts/for-loop</guid><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jan 2013 09:28:42 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I just recalled an interesting theory mentioned by my C lecturer back in uni days, use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;++i&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;i++&lt;/code&gt; in a for-loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-c&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; len&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// whatever code here....    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically (or without compiler optimization), &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;++i&lt;/code&gt; is faster than &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;i++&lt;/code&gt; because &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;i++&lt;/code&gt; need to return the un-incremented value and store it first, before performing the increment. But, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;++i&lt;/code&gt; can return the incremented value without storing it first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the claim is valid, for most languages and modern compilers, it doesn’t really matter. In Java, it will produce the same bytecode. I think in modern C / C++ compilers, they did some optimization to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have the old habit of using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;++i&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;i++&lt;/code&gt; when the rest of my team use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;i++&lt;/code&gt;. Need to take a note on this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code Consistency&lt;/p&gt;

So, let’s make some spiced chai, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, I put the tea leaves and garam masala into the portafilter. Switch on the espresso machine and let it brew for a couple of minutes. Put 2 teaspoon of sugar into the cup. Pour in milk. And done, my easy peasy spiced chai.&lt;/p&gt;

    ps: Atm, I&apos;m still thinking on the API design for this multi query search system. How to achieve good performance of tree data structure searching against typical relational database without introducing too much complexities? I&apos;ve created custom index last time, not quite sure whether I want to do it again. Should I?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Printing A5 size on A4 papers using iText]]></title><description><![CDATA[Automating bulk printing A4-sized papers into A5 size]]></description><link>https://www.faizhasim.com/posts/printing-a5-size-on-a4-papers-using-itext</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.faizhasim.com/posts/printing-a5-size-on-a4-papers-using-itext</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Dec 2012 09:28:42 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;My wife (edit in 2020: now ex-wife) asked me whether I can help her to print one of her ebook collections into A5 sized for better reading.
We have a normal A4 printer at home, and I’m planning to print 2 A5 pages into one page of A4 paper. We also want to remove the complexities of sorting the pages manually after printing (total pages are slightly less than 1000 pages).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cut to the chase, my rough idea is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divide the PDF pages into half. First 500 pages (let’s called it head pages, for the sake of discussion) will be printed onto left hand side of the paper. The last 500 pages (also referred to as tail pages) will be printed onto right hand side of the paper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since our printer does not support duplex printing, I need to print odds page first, then even pages. After doing some test prints, the position of the head pages switched with tail pages. Which means, for even pages, head pages on right hand side and tail pages on left hand side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone who knows OS X knows that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preview_(Mac_OS)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Preview&lt;/a&gt; is a really good app, in which functionality is quite close to Adobe Acrobat Professional with tighter integration to OS itself when modifying the PDF. Furthermore, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automator_(software)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Automator&lt;/a&gt; app is also bundle together to automate your workflow, including PDF manipulation. However, after spending 1/2 hour to determine whether these tools can help, I think I gave up on them. My need is more complex from what have been offered out-of-the-box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I quickly remembered iText library. And, I wrote a Java routine to basically convert the document. I think, no point explaining everything what the code does. Well, you can ask me if you want to know more and I’ll try to help out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; pdfmagic&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

Originally it was username: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tmadmin&lt;/code&gt; and password: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tmadmin&lt;/code&gt;. This is the unrestricted account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, I want to reboot the modem and I forgot that password! I’ve tried to login using tmuser but there’s no option to reboot the modem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cut to the chase, with just some HTML debugging using Chrome debugger, I found out that this modem wasn’t designed to be secured at all. The password is in plain text and the validation was done purely on the UI level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://192.168.1.1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://192.168.1.1&lt;/a&gt;, and log in using as any user (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tmadmin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tmuser&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;support&lt;/code&gt;). Then go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://192.168.1.1/password.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://192.168.1.1/password.html&lt;/a&gt;. View the source and you’ll see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script language=&amp;quot;javascript&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!-- hide
pwdAdmin = &amp;#39;12345678&amp;#39;;
pwdSupport = &amp;#39;support&amp;#39;;
pwdUser = &amp;#39;tmuser&amp;#39;;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for this case, now I know that “tmadmin” password is 12345678.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, moral of story is: Even though you have changed password for the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tmadmin&lt;/code&gt; user, it’s not enough. You will need to change the password for non-admin users such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tmuser&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;support&lt;/code&gt;, because this modem security is absolute joke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Funny "__OBJC_CLASS_$_" during compile/linking]]></title><description><![CDATA[I've been following the CoreData tutorial and I receive errors ...

Most of them are background schedulers and all of them are implemented using Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not found a proper solution yet, but I’m listing down all the challenges that I encounter when designing the solution for it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-tenanted services&lt;/strong&gt;
In which the configuration can change dynamically during runtime. For example, one of the email notification services may consists of different repository settings.
At the moment, an ExecutorService is assigned to a particular email notification repository. Thus, if the settings for a  particular repository is updated, the corresponding ExecutorService is restarted. (At that time we think it makes sense not to manually handle all the Futures and use a single ExecutorService. Moreover, if you don’t manually purge the ThreadPoolExecutor, you will have memory leaks.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different &lt;strong&gt;behaviour&lt;/strong&gt; on the services. Some of them simply do some processing on a fix interval, in which past jobs are processed. There jobs that need more accuracy, so we actually manually planned for the execution in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the moment, it’s possible for multiple services on multiple repositories to be scheduled at the same time. This could easily starve the CPU when that happens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should 1 service is managed by 1 ExecutorService instead of 1 ExecutorService per repository?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If yes, Futures must be manually managed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume 1 ExecutorService per repository, we can reduce the impact of issue 3, by “pausing” certain ExecutorServices to give a breathing room for the CPU to process others. I think this is not gonna work. I can’t figure out when to “pause”  on which ExecutorService, and likewise for “resuming” the ExecutorService.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should we rely on a master ExecutorService, similar to Grand Central Dispatch in OSX? We can archive this using Hazelcast in JavaWorld. Problem is, there’s no ScheduledExecutorService for Hazelcast. Going this path probably means, create a local ScheduledExecutorService just to submit the jobs to Hazelcast.&lt;/li&gt;
